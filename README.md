# Mashin Standard Modules

The Mashin Standard Modules repository contains a set of high-quality, core modules that can be used by all Mashin projects without fear. These modules have been reviewed and tested by the Mashin core team to ensure that they are reliable, efficient, and easy to use.

These modules are designed to be lightweight and self-contained, with no external dependencies. This means that they can be used in any Mashin project without worrying about conflicts or compatibility issues.

In addition to the core modules, the Mashin Standard Modules repository also includes the SDK used by all Mashin projects. This SDK provides a set of APIs and tools that can be used to interact with the Mashin platform, as well as a development environment that helps you test and debug your projects.

The Mashin Standard Modules are intended to provide a solid foundation for building Mashin projects, and are constantly updated and improved by the Mashin core team. If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
